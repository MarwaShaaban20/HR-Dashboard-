# HR Dashboard & Data Analysis

This repository contains a project that showcases an interactive HR dashboard created in **Power BI**. The dashboard provides key insights into employee demographics, job roles, promotions, retrenchment, and other HR-related metrics.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project includes various attributes such as **Age, Attrition, Business Travel, Daily Rate, Department, Distance From Home, Education, Job Role**, and more. I performed extensive **data cleaning** to ensure data quality and consistency before applying multiple **DAX expressions** for insightful visualizations.

### Dataset Details:
- **Attributes**: Age, Attrition, BusinessTravel, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, Gender, JobLevel, JobRole, MaritalStatus, MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany, etc.

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and handled missing data.
- Normalized categorical variables for consistency.
- Applied transformations to ensure correct data types for different columns.

### DAX Expressions
Several **DAX expressions** were used to calculate:
- Total Employees by Gender
- Employees Due for Promotion
- Retrenchment Percentage
- Employee Job Satisfaction
- Distance from Office Breakdown
- Job Role Distribution and many more.

### Key Visualizations:
- **Total Employees**: Displays the total count of employees segmented by gender.
- **Due for Promotion and Retrenchment**: Highlights employees eligible for promotion and those marked for retrenchment.
- **Job Levels & Satisfaction**: Shows the distribution of employees by job level and satisfaction ratings.
- **Distance from Office**: A pie chart to categorize employees based on their proximity to the office.
- **Employee Attrition & Job Role**: Analyzes attrition trends across different job roles and departments.

### Dashboard Features:
- Navigation buttons for easy access to different views (Home, Details, Action).
- A summary of employees eligible for promotion or retrenchment.
- Dynamic charts for year of service, job level, and more.

This project highlights my ability to clean data, perform calculations using DAX, and create interactive and informative dashboards using **Power BI**.
